## Description

This activity provides a combination of physical and on-screen experiences for learners. This is a goal-based activity, thus learners need to plan, execute and debug (if needed) to go through the maze. This activity requires collaboration and communication between players to reach a final destination.

## Steps

* Use masking tape to build a simple maze on the floor
* Place some of learners’ favorite toys/treats on different spots on the maze
* Ask player one to wait at the beginning of the maze and move only when the program announces an action
* Ask player two to use the Weavly coding environment to build a program to move player one through the maze
* Select the “Play” button and ask player one to move based on the steps announced by the program

## Tips

* Start with straight and simple paths before introducing more complex mazes
* You can use grid squares to build your maze as some learners may benefit from seeing the grid squares to navigate
* Reward both players if they successfully finish going through the maze
* Moderator can pause the program and help player two to fix (debug) the program if player one starts to move off the maze
* In addition to the audio labels spoken by the program, the moderator can speak each action block once played to reinforce the learning of directions

## Skill Development

* Directional
* Spatial
* Gross motor movements
* Sequencing
* Planning
* Debugging
* Social skills/Communication

## Level Up!

Once your players are familiar with this activity, get them to make their own maze and play then play this game.
