## Description

This activity can use any coding environment for a fun and interactive way to learn about directions. Any type of movement counts as dancing in this activity whether it is stepping, jumping, wheeling, blinking, head movements, or hitting a single switch.

As a starter, you can try...

For younger children:

* [Weavly Pre-built Program](https://create.weavly.org/?v=0.7&t=mixed&w=space&p=1Bb1bB1Bb1Bb1&c=aab&a=123456ABDabd)

## Steps

* Select a short song or music your players like
* Use Weavly to build a sequence of actions
* Line up your players
* Ask them to follow each step of the program that is announced
* Play the music and your program at once and let the fun begin

## Tips

* Announce every step of the program as it is executed
* For longer songs, you can replay the same program
* Try to keep the players focused on the running program and correct their movements

## Skill Development

* Gross motor movements 
* Dancing
* Directions
* Sequencing

## Level Up!

Once your players are familiar with this activity, get them to write their own programs. You can also pair them in teams and make them create a dance competition.
