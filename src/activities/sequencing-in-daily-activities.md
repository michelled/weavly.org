## Description

Sequencing is an abstract concept and takes a lot of practice to master for many kids. Learners can try these activities to understand how a series of objects and events can happen in a specific and logical order. The following activities include simple sequences that are familiar to children and are a natural part of their daily routines.

* Going to bed \[N steps]: \[Link]
* Brushing teeth \[N steps]: \[Link]
* Growing a plant \[N steps]: \[Link]
* Making a sand castle \[N steps]: \[Link]

## Steps

* Choose one of the above activities.
* You can either print the cards or use these slides: \[Link]
* Ask the learner to describe the cards for each activity.
* Use one of the activities to show the learner how to put the cards in the correct order.
* Ask the learner to put either the digital or printed cards in order.

## Tips

* Begin with simpler activities with fewer steps, such as brushing teeth or going to bed.
* When a learner puts items in an incorrect order, ask them to describe their reasoning.

## Skill Development

* Sequencing
* Sorting
* Pattern recognition

## Level Up!

* Talk to learners about their daily activities to help them build their understanding of sequencing. Throughout the day, ask them to explain what they are doing first, next, and last as those steps are happening. For example, when they are having meals, tying shoes, using the bathroom, or going outside, ask them to explain the steps.
* Use a few or several images from magazines/flyers/newspapers/storybooks or family photos. Ask learners to put these items in the correct order either chronological or logical. Reinforce the vocabulary by asking them what happened first, next, and last.
