## Description

In this activity learners can explore the sound features of the different action blocks. This activity provides an on-screen and sensory experience to introduce learners to discover and become familiar with the sounds on Weavly. Each action block has a unique and distinct sound. Once action blocks are selected as part of the program, Weavly can provide real-time sound for the selected action block. This interactive activity encourages learners to use their sensory ability to identify cause and effect, and inspire creativity in their program and coded creations. 

## Steps

Open the Weavly coding environment.

* Select an action block that will move the character forward and listen to the audio sound for that action block. Ask the learner to repeat the sound they heard for that selected block.
* Refresh and play the sounds for the following action blocks: 

  1. Move forward
  2. Move backwards
  3. Turn right
  4. Turn left
* Provide learners with a chance to listen to the sound features while exploring the action blocks.

## Tips

* Ask learners to repeat the sound, consider singing or sounding out the audio (i.e. beep beep, chi chee), as well as using kinesthetic movement (I.e. clapping, tapping) 
* Set up a space with a relatively quiet environment to detect audio changes or use headset/earphones 
* Turn off pen toggle feature to help learners focus their attention on the sound

## Skill Development

* Directional skills
* Sorting
* Musical

## Level Up!

* Add multiple action blocks to their sequence and use the speed control to play with the speed for the musical creation.
