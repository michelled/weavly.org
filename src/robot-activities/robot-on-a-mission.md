## Description

In this activity, learners plan and build a path to direct Dash to move to a specific object on a grid map.

## Steps

* Use a taping mask or chalk to build a grid map on the floor
* Once your grid is ready, place a few items such as toys on different grid cells
* Select a starting point for Dash and place it on the map
* Use Weavly to build a sequence to make Dash move to a selected destination on the grid map
* Play your sequence program
* Pause your program and debug once Dash starts to move away from the desired destination

## Tips

* If you are doing this activity on a tabletop or an elevated surface, block the edges to prevent robots from falling
* You can use any object, draw or write something on the map
* To make this fun, build a story around the objects on your map and give Dash a specific mission to accomplish

## Skill Development

* Directional
* Mathematical
* Sequencing
* Spatial

## Level Up 

* Complete this activity again with a planned shape or pattern in mind
* Restrict the number of cells the robot can move
