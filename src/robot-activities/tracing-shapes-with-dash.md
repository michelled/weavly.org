## Description

In this activity, learners plan and build a sequence of movements to trace simple shapes.

## Steps

* Place a large sheet of paper on a hard and flat surface and tape its edges to the floor
* Tape a marker on each side of Dash
* Place one of the printed shapes on the large sheet and tape it to secure it in place
* Turn on Dash and start using the coding environment to make Dash trace the shape on the paper

## **Tips**

* If you are doing this activity on a tabletop or an elevated surface, block the edges to prevent robots from falling
* If you don’t have access to a printer, you can draw or use masking tape to build a shape on the large sheet of paper
* Make sure the marker tips can touch the paper
* Traced lines may not be straight and accurate as markers may move in different directions

## Skill Development

* Analytical/Reasoning
* Directional
* Mathematical
* Sequencing
* Spatial

## Level Up 

Complete this activity again with a new shape or pattern.
